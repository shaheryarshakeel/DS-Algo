Problem statement :

  Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
  whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

  A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
  in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For
  instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4] ,
  and so do the numbers [2, 4].

  Note
    that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid
    subsequences of the array.


Solution :

public static boolean isValidSubsequence(List<Integer> array, List<Integer> sequence) {

    int seqPointer = 0;

    for (Integer value : array){
      if (seqPointer == sequence.size()){
        break;
      }else if (sequence.get(seqPointer) == value){
        seqPointer++;
      }
    }

    return seqPointer == sequence.size();
  }
